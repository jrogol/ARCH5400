Late Tuesday had turned to early Wednesday, and if the Cleveland Indians? collapse hadn?t been indignity enough, their manager Terry Francona had become a prisoner in his own stadium.
He left a postgame interview in a room beneath the stands, and tried to walk back to the team?s clubhouse ? only to run into a mob of fans leaving Cleveland?s 9-3 Game 6 World Series loss to the Chicago Cubs. The crowd was filtered through two barriers set up in the corridor, forcing Francona and a team public relations man to stop as the fans pushed through. The opening between the barriers was controlled by a vigilant security guard, who appeared unconcerned that the home team?s manger was standing at the other end trying to get past.
Or maybe the guard did know, and she was just going to make Francona squirm, the way all of Cleveland is squirming the end of a World Series they could have won days ago.
?Wait!? the guard shouted, as a woman pushed by with a baby stroller followed by five people in Indians T-shirts.
?Can I get through now?? Francona asked politely, but with exasperation building in his voice.
?No! Wait,? the guard said, waving more fans past.

Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians face a World Series Game 7 for the ages

148,2016-11-02 13:46:05,Hello and welcome,"Game seven. It?s been said they?re the two greatest words in sports ? besides, perhaps, free beer or brunch burger ? a one-off crucible where the winners through the years have been minted as legends and the losers cruelly fitted with goat horns.
Tonight the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians will face off in the seventh game of a World Series that?s deadlocked at three games apiece. The ultramarathon that is the Major League Baseball season ? more than 200 games when you include spring training, the 162-game regular season and the play-offs ? is reduced to a sprint.
All signs indicate tonight?s finale could be a classic, none more than the delicious starting pitching matchup between Indians? Corey Kluber and the Cubs? Kyle Hendricks, both Cy Young Award contenders for their respective leagues.
We?ll unpack that and much more with first pitch a little more than six hours away.

147,2016-11-02 14:29:16,Tonight's starters,"Kluber and Hendricks are widely expected to finish high in the balloting for this year?s Cy Young Awards. That means tonight will likely mark only the third pitching matchup in a Game 7 of the World Series between starters to finish in the top five of Cy Young voting.
The others? The Diamondbacks? Curt Schilling against the Yankees? Roger Clemens in 2001 and the Royals? Bret Saberhagen against the Cardinals? John Tudor in 1985.
Both pitchers spoke with the media before last night?s Game 6. Here are some excerpts:
Corey Kluber

Given this has been your first postseason experience, how valuable do you think this month has been for you just in terms of overall development even moving forward?
Kluber: I think first and foremost it?s been a blast. I think that we?ve all really enjoyed ourselves. I think we can take a lot from the way we approached it, and not treating it more than just each game is another game and trying to go out and win that day. Not trying to look too far ahead or things like that. I think there?s value to taking that approach throughout the course of a season, too.
For years and years, the regular routine was to have starters pitch on three days? rest, and then in seven days it became four days. For you, what is the difference now that you?ve come back once on three days and might do it again tomorrow?
Kluber: I mean, I guess for me personally I spend a little more time doing the different methods of recovery and stuff like that that we have available to us.
But I still get in the same amount of work in between, it?s just a little bit more condensed. I haven?t, for me personally, I haven?t found much of a difference yet in the way I feel when I go out there on three days? rest as opposed to four. And I don?t know if that?s just doing the extra recovery stuff to where you get as close to normal as you can possibly get. But that?s really the only difference for me is spending more time trying to recover on those three days instead of having four days to do it.
All season long you knew when you were going to pitch, and tomorrow obviously you don?t know if you?re going to pitch. So what is your mental frame thinking about tomorrow as of right now?
Kluber: I mean, doing all my work in between the last start, and if it gets to tomorrow, that start. In doing all my work it was the same trying to get myself prepared. I?ll be rooting as hard as anybody for us to win tonight. But I think that my mindset was I?d rather be prepared and not have to pitch than try to will us to not get to a Game 7 and then not be ready when it comes.
Kyle Hendricks

Kyle, knock on wood, there?s a Game 7 for you tomorrow, what would it mean? It?s the ultimate in baseball to pitch a Game 7.
Hendricks: Exactly, this is the ultimate dream. You dream of getting to the World Series, winning the World Series. When you?re out in your backyard as a kid, playing Little League at the field with your friends, this is the moment you dream about, Game 7, 3-2, two outs, something like that, bottom of the 9th. But it?s always Game 7 of the World Series.
So when we get there tomorrow, I?m just going to embrace the opportunity like I have the rest of this postseason, honestly. Approach it like any other game, simple thoughts, the same old thing.
You have a guy on your team who won a Game 7 in 2002 and won a Game 6 three years ago in John Lackey. Has he imparted any wisdom on you about how to handle tomorrow?
Hendricks: Not particularly in regards to tomorrow, but I?ve learned so much from John already. I think the way he approaches every single game, you know, I think that?s what prepares him for those big games and that?s what I?ve learned watching him, and I?ve tried to implement some of that into my routine, just taking that same ruthless approach, every day, every single start, even the regular season. So that when you get to these big moments, it?s basically like it has been the whole year, I think.
What?s your take on a team having a guy starting games 1, 4, and 7 and Kluber in particular?
Hendricks: You know, I don?t think there?s too many guys that could do it to start, so obviously he?s a special guy. But Kluber, you can just see it. The way he takes to the mound, he?s always locked in. He has a very, very good mental approach from what you can see from the outside, keeping things simple, just trying to execute pitches.
Like I said, there?s not many guys in this league that could do that. I think it speaks volumes to him as a pitcher and what he can do."
146,2016-11-02 14:41:11,,"On a beautiful Game 7 Wednesday, Cleveland emerged from the wreckage of Tuesday?s Game 6 debacle determined to believe that maybe, just maybe, their Indians can finally win that world championship that has eluded them for 68 years. People walked to their neighborhood groceries and banks wearing Indians T-shirts and caps, joking that the improbable 75F weather is ?Indian summer?. Needless to say, most of them are not talking about the election. Only one topic seems to be on most people?s minds. As heard from a group of lunching ladies at a sidewalk table in the Little Italy section of town:
?My friend said: ?I don?t think my liver can take anymore alcohol after that game last night.??
?If they win tonight, they?re going to have to have a holiday the next day because everyone is going to be up all night.?
Yup, they?ve gone baseball mad around here."
145,2016-11-02 14:51:35,,"There is no tomorrow when it?s Game 7 of the World Series. That means traditional adherence to the rules governing rest for starting pitchers and bullpen management are tossed out the window in favor of an all-hands-on-deck approach.
Case in point: Tom Verducci reports that Jake Arrieta, the winning pitcher in Game 2 and last night?s Game 6, told Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio that he would be available to pitch in relief in tonight?s Game 7 if necessary. They have him down for 20 pitches.

That would be some turnaround for Arrieta, last year?s Cy Young Award winner who scattered three hits and two runs over 5.2 innings (and threw 102 pitches) before Mike Montgomery, Aroldis Chapman, Pedro Strop and Travis Wood finished the job."
144,2016-11-02 15:11:57,,"Bill Murray news: As the Cubs are playing, we?re legally obliged to do a fun story about Bill Murray (and, in fairness, all stories about Bill Murray are fun.

Anyway, it turns out he decided to give his spare ticket to a random fan, Karen Michel, at last night?s game. ?He turns around and says, ?Here, here?s a ticket,?? Michel told MLB. ?And he kind of shuttled me into the door. I thought it was just a ticket to get in. But it was a ticket to sit right here [next to Murray].?

143,2016-11-02 15:23:17,Weather report,"We?ve experienced some chilly World Series in years past ? not least the 1997 Marlins-Indians series, where in a memorable Game 4, snow fell throughout the game and temperatures hovered around the 38F mark ? but tonight?s decider should be unseasonably warm. A chance of rain remains, however.
We?re expecting temperatures in the upper 60s or lower 70s; the chance of rain increases from 19% at 8pm to about 50% by 11pm.
Brian Wimer, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in a statement: ?While a brief shower cannot be ruled out during Wednesday evening, if Game 7 runs late or goes into extra innings, then the chance of drenching rain will increase.?
Major League Baseball announced late on Tuesday night that it was moving up the start time by 8 minutes to 8pm."
142,2016-11-02 15:37:23,Jim Thome to throw first pitch,"Jim Thome, the Indians? franchise leader in home runs, will throw the first pitch at Progressive Field tonight. Former players from each team have thrown the first pitch prior to each game in the series.
Thome, one of three players with a statue out beyond center field, played for the Indians between 1991 and 2002, and again in 2011. He was there the last time the Indians advanced to the World Series, in 1997 ? only to fall short against the Marlins in Game 7. Thome never again reached the World Series.
?It?s what you live for,? said Thome, who grew up a Cubs fan in Peoria, Illinois. ?It?s what you dream of. As an ex-player, you feel it with them. You want this to happen so badly.?"
141,2016-11-02 15:42:54,,"If Chicago do win tonight and capture their first championship since 1908, they?ll have done it the hard way: only six teams in history have come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the World Series.

As we mentioned before, MLB have brought the start time forward ? but only by eight minutes. We?ll begin at 8pm ET. Cross your fingers it stays fine."
139,2016-11-02 15:58:09,Tonight's starting line-ups,"Tyler Naquin has paid for his costly mistake in Game 6 ? and he?s out of the Indians line-up for tonight?s winner-takes-all showdown. Naquin, who let a fly ball turn into a two-run double in the first inning of Tuesday night?s loss, is out, and Rajai Davis is back in.

Carlos Santana will lead off for the Indians, followed by Jason Kipnis, Francisco Lindor, Mike Napoli and Jose Ramirez. Lonnie Chisenhall will hit sixth, with Davis seventh, Coco Crisp eighth and Roberto Perez catching and hitting ninth.
The Cubs, by contrast, are sticking with what works: they?ll use the same line-up that crushed the Indians 9-3 on Tuesday.
Dexter Fowler will lead off, followed by Kyle Schwarber, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo. Ben Zobrist, who is hitting .391 in the series, will hit fifth. Addison Russell, who tied a World Series record with six RBIs in Game 6, will hit sixth, followed by Willson Contreras, Jason Heyward and Javier Baez.
The Cubs have managed just one run off Kluber in his two starts so far."
138,2016-11-02 16:11:46,,"If you?re watching tonight?s Game 7 to take your mind off the election, be sure to switch off during the commercials: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have bought last-minute ads to air during the game.
The Trump campaign has booked three commercial spots, a campaign spokesman has confirmed to CNN. And Hillary Clinton?s campaign has booked four spots, according to a source at Fox.
The market price for an ad during Game 7 exceeds $500,000, but the campaigns will be paying less, because broadcasters are legally required to give candidates the ?lowest unit rate? for ad time in the weeks before an election.
During Game 6 on Tuesday night, the Clinton campaign had two national ads. Trump didn?t have any, but the NRA did have one.
Fox, which is broadcasting the game nationally, expects Game 7 to be the network?s most-watched MLB game in 15 years, with an audience of about 30 million viewers."

10) 1962 World Series | New York Yankees 1, San Francisco Giants 0
The Giants trailed 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth at Candlestick Park and were down to their final out, but they had runners at second and third with future Hall of Fame slugger Willie McCovey at the plate. That?s when McCovey ripped a line drive that surely would have driven in the championship-winning runs ? if not for Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson, whose hair-trigger catch for the final out preserved Ralph Terry?s four-hit shutout.

136,2016-11-02 16:17:45,,"Four hours before the start of the biggest World Series game in the recent history of the Cubs and Indians, and downtown Cleveland is strangely dead. Sidewalks that were packed at this time before Tuesday?s Game 6 are mostly empty. The East 4th St alley of bars that serve as a pre-game drinking spot for the baseball stadium and basketball arena just a couple blocks away was far from filled. At this point on Tuesday, those same bars were packed. The few fans that did gather were all wearing Cubs shirts and caps.
In fact, the vast majority of fans in downtown Cleveland this afternoon appear to be from Chicago. This was anticipated by locals, who figured that if the Cubs won Game 6 they would pour into town to celebrate what could be their first championship in 108 years. What is missing ? is Cleveland fans.

It?s an odd sight: downtown Cleveland devoid of Cleveland fans. There is no lack of enthusiasm for the Indians in the city?s neighborhoods away from downtown. Shop windows are filled with Indians pictures and Indians pennants. Everybody, it seems, is wearing an Indians shirt. But for some reason that has not translated to the area around Progressive Field.
Certainly there has been much anecdotal evidence of enthusiastic drinking in anticipation of the team?s first title since 1948. Maybe fans are nursing hangovers. Or maybe they anticipate the doom known well to Cleveland fans, who have only this summer?s Cavaliers title to celebrate among their sports teams since the Browns won the NFL championship in 1964.
Even the 3.09 pm Green line train in from the east suburbs that was packed with baseball fans on Tuesday had just a handful of passengers today.
Weird."

Naquin let a fly ball drop between him and right fielder Lonnie Chisenhall in the first inning on Tuesday, a mistake that paved the way to Chicago?s 9-3 win over Cleveland. In the fourth inning, with Cleveland down 7-2, Naquin came up with the bases loaded, but struck out.
Francona said he feels Naquin is ?pressing a little bit. During the regular season you might kind of let him get through it, but with one game left and with [Corey] Kluber pitching, we?re trying to put a premium on catching the ball.?
Rajai Davis will start in center. With the prospect of facing lefties Aroldis Chapman and Jon Lester later on, Francona wanted the right-handed hitting Davis in the lineup.

Dr Sean Maguire skipped out on to go see about a girl ? but that only forced a seventh game the next day. The Red Sox struck first with three runs in the third and the end of the team?s 57-year championship drought seemed within reach. But Tony Perez?s two-run homer off the Green Monster closed it to 3-2 in the sixth, Pete Rose tied it with an RBI single in the seventh and Joe Morgan?s two-out base hit to center field in the ninth capped Boston?s misery ? and gave birth to the Big Red Machine."

8) 1955 World Series | Brooklyn Dodgers 2, New York Yankees 0
Next year finally came for the hard-luck Dodgers, who saw off the Yankees in the World Series after coming up short against their crosstown rivals in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953. The Dodgers scratched out runs on an RBI single and sacrifice fly by Gil Hodges, but it would prove enough Johnny Podres scattered eight hits over nine shutout innings to capture the first championship in franchise history and their lone win in Brooklyn. The game is perhaps best remembered for defensive substitute Sandy Amor?s? game-saving catch in left field off the bat of Yogi Berra, which keyed a 7-6-3 double play that short-circuited the Yankees? biggest threat of the day."

The Giants had won Game 1 on a standout performance by Madison Bumgarner, then Game 5 when the right-hander pitched the first complete-game shutout in more than a decade in World Series play. But when the Royals forced a seventh game with a 10-0 victory in Game 6, the Giants ace went above and beyond the call of duty on two days? rest. After Michael Morse?s broken-bat RBI single broke a 2-2 deadlock in the fourth, Bumgarner entered to protect the one-run lead.

Here?s one that Indians fans of a certain age will no doubt be grappling with tonight. The last time Cleveland played in the World Series, they led 2-1 entering the bottom of the ninth of Game 7. But Jos? Mesa allowed singles by Mois?s Alou and Charles Johnson followed by a sacrifice fly by Craig Counsell that knotted the score at 2-2 and bought the Marlins new life in extra innings. With Cleveland?s Game 3 starter Charles Nagy having entered in relief, the Marlins loaded the bases in the bottom of the 11th ? thanks in part to a crucial error by second baseman Tony Fernandez on what might have been an inning-ending double play ? setting the stage for ?dgar Renter?a?s walkoff single to center."

The 36-year-old right-hander lost both starts in Game 1 and Game 5, but was given a shot at redemption in Game 7 at Griffith Stadium after the Senators rallied from 3-1 down to tie the score in the bottom of the eighth. Johnson entered in the ninth and pitched four scoreless innings, earning the victory in relief after Earl McNeely?s championship-clinching RBI double in the bottom of the 12th."

3) 2001 World Series | Arizona Diamondbacks 3, New York Yankees 2
A classic pitchers? duel between starters Curt Schilling and Roger Clemens (the AL Cy Young winner) was given even more juice when Randy Johnson (the NL Cy Young winner) entered in relief. Once Alfonso Soriano homered in the eighth to give New York a 2-1 lead, the outcome seemed but a handshake away. After all, the Yankees had Mariano Rivera waiting in the wings. But a two-inning save proved a bridge too far for the presumptive greatest closer ever as Rivera, who had struck out the side in the eighth, couldn?t work out of trouble in the ninth as Luis Gonzalez delivered the coup de gr?ce with an RBI blooper to center."

The so-called Worst to First Series featured two teams that had finished in last place only a year earlier, a happening unprecedented in baseball history. What came next was one of the hardest fought and most highly charged Fall Classics ever played, with five games decided by one run, four coming down to the final at-bat and three going to extra innings. Game 7 ticked all those boxes as Jack Morris of the Twins and John Smoltz of the Braves engaged in a pitchers? duel for the ages.

It was a bizarre World Series that saw the losing Yankees finish with more than twice as many runs on aggregate (55) than the winning Pirates (27), but you could hardly script a more exciting finale. The Pirates trailed 7-4 in the bottom of the eighth but responded with five runs, only to see the Yankees plate a pair to tie it at 9-9.

116,2016-11-02 19:18:32,,"A big night ahead...
David Lengel here...
If a certain iconic baseball broadcaster were writing this live blog, perhaps he would start off with ?Hello everybody and a very pleasant evening to you wherever you may be.? 
And actually, it?s much more than a pleasant evening, or morning or afternoon for baseball fans, and that?s because we?re about an hour away from what is unquestionably the most highly anticipated finish to a season in recent memory. 
Personally speaking, I?ve been jumping out of my skin all day long waiting for first pitch, waiting to watch what happens right along with what will be a mammoth global baseball audience. 
It?s perhaps less pleasant for fans of the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians: their supporters have been tortured for decades, and are agonizing about what may or may not happen right up until the very end of one of their age-old title droughts. They?ve spent the day playing out the game in their heads, wondering what these nine or more innings will ultimately yield. They?ve been speaking with friends and family, trying their best to keep calm over the past 24 hours. And they?ve been thinking about all of those no longer here, who watched their team try and fail to win a lone World Series title, year after year after year.
A Game 7 in the World Series brings along a wide range of emotions for fans of this sport, and of course, it brings closure. Tomorrow, the season will be over and one fan base will wake up in a world that they could have only dreamed of a day earlier.
The question is, will it be in Chicago or Cleveland?
And that reminds me, why not send in your predictions for what we hope will be nothing short of an epic finale. Tweet your thoughts over to @lengeldavid or david.lengel.freelance@theguardian.com - it would be great to have you all involved. So gear up, get your popcorn ready. First pitch is coming up shortly."
115,2016-11-02 19:38:15,,"Tito Francona
He is one of the more successful big game managers in recent history, and tonight, he?ll have the luxury of a reasonably rested big-game bullpen. The airwaves were buzzing all day long about a possible formula for Francona - four innings from starter Corey Kluber, three from Andrew Miller and two from Allen. That?s a best case scenario of course, and is likely if the Indians manage to get on top of Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. 
Just a quick note about his benching of Tyler Naquin - in an era of cagey coaches and managers, it was refreshing to hear his candid comments, where he said that he was ?pressing a little bit. During the regular season you might kind of let him get through it, but with one game left and with [Corey] Kluber pitching, we?re trying to put a premium on catching the ball.?
But that?s just Tito, a tremendous managerial talent, who also is also cool enough let the world in on how he fell asleep eating pretzels and peanut butter last night, waking up now and then to take another bite."
114,2016-11-02 19:41:22,,"Our man at Progressive Field
Les Carpenter has filed this report as we get set for Game 7:
Final games of a series are always fun because managers are released to use any pitcher they see fit to win the ultimate game. Remember Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 of the NLDS coming out of the bullpen to get the last two outs of the clinching game for the Dodgers? It feels like about four months ago. Both managers tonight have that same dilemma but in different ways.
Cleveland?s Terry Francona has a reasonably-rested ace reliever Andrew Miller to use tonight if he needs. Francona gave no indication about how long he will pitch Miller ? if at all ? but he talked about how he has brought Miller into games in the fifth inning in the past and left open the idea that he would again in this game.
Cubs manager Joe Maddon talked to Game 5 starter Jon Lester after last night?s game and suggested that Lester could pitch at least an inning or two if the Cubs needed him.
?Jon?s able,? Maddon said. ?I don?t want to put him into a dirty inning, I don?t think that would be appropriate. But being that it?s on his regular workout day, he?s probably got a solid two in him.?
Maddon also said he did not regret using his closer Aroldis Chapman for long stretches in the last two games, potentially weakening Chapman?s effectiveness.
?It?s about winning now,? Maddon said. ?Yesterday that was a real clear-cut decision for me, how to work (the 7th inning when Chapman came in) the threat there was that had we not done it then Aroldis would have had a mores stressful 1- 1 2/3 innings in the eighth and ninth.?
END - David here again...
It?s interesting about Lester - and remember, his entering the game also means a switch at catcher, a move that means less in the American League. David Ross has caught all but three of Lester?s innings this season."

112,2016-11-02 19:48:25,,"Ratings
You may have heard by now that ratings wise, this World Series has been a monster. Actually, the Mets Giants NL Wildcard game was the most watched in the history of that early-round affair, so to some degree, this has been building. In an era of declining ratings across the board, and during a time where the NFL has ruled the TV ratings universe, and even during a period where the US election has dominated, Major League Baseball is ruling the roost, and that has got to be music to the ears of commissioner Rob Manfred.
Here?s a post from our friends at the AP about ratings:
The Chicago Cubs? 9-3 win over Cleveland was the most-watched World Series Game 6 since 1997.
Tuesday night?s game had a 13.3 rating and 23 share on Fox, drawing 23.4 million viewers. It was the highest-rated Game 6 since the New York Yankees? 2009 clincher against Philadelphia drew a 13.4/22 and the most-watched since Cleveland?s win at Florida in 1997 was seen by 23.7 million.
The game drew 425,000 for Spanish-language coverage on Fox Deportes and 151,000 for digital coverage on Fox Sports Go, for a total audience of 24 million.
This year?s Series entered Game 7 averaging an 11.3/20 and 20 million viewers, the most watched since Boston?s four-game sweep of St. Louis in 2004.
The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a program, and the share is the percentage showing a broadcast among those homes with TVs on at the time."

The string section of the Cleveland orchestra are playing the national anthem, and the fans, invited to sing along, are doing just that. They?re putting together a simple and elegant version that, at least for me, is pitch perfect. I give it full points, 10/10, and I?m not sure I?ve ever awarded that score before.

BALL FOUR! Here comes Rajai Davis, who seems to have some sort of penchant for the dramatic - he represents the tying run, just as he did in the eighth. Pitching coach Chris Bosio is on for a chat. Now he?s gone - here we go."

That will do it for Edwards Jr - here comes Mike Montgomery to get the hardest out. Breathe everyone, breathe."

Wouldn't it be something if Trevor Bauer and Mike Montgomery end up as the final pitchers tonight in relief. Hart High teammates.

It?s gonna be up there!"
154,2016-11-03 00:56:11,,"How about that? I mean (shaking his head) I?ve seen the guys and the coaches and the players who have been through it all, and the fans...it?s unbelievable, to be a part of this, I don?t have words to really tell you how I feel about this, I think it?s all surreal.

153,2016-11-03 01:05:58,It happened!,"It wouldn?t have been the same if Chicago steamrolled over Cleveland. 
It needed to be hard earned, they needed to be pressed to the limit. The Cubs needed to climb out of a 3-1 hole, because if you?re going to undo 108 years of history, it has to come in a unique way. They had to blow a 5-1 lead. They had to watch their nearly flawless closer melt down. They had to bring on a pair of back-end roster relievers to pull it out. 
It?s not that the trauma validates the achievement - a championship is a championship, as a sweep or in seven. But for this franchise, the lovable losers, it had to be tedious, heart-stopping and dramatic for the drought to end in a way that felt right 
And it did. 
Congratulations to the Cubs, and the Cleveland Indians, who put baseball on top and turned October and November a into in festival of the game."
152,2016-11-03 01:11:32,It's over!,"The Cubs will wake up as champions for the first time in more than a century, and Cleveland fans, who should be proud of this ballclub, will begin to pick up the pieces. The season is over, winter is coming and months will pass before the carousel starts up for another round. It?s been a historic playoffs - thank for following it with us. Stay tuned for more World Series coverage, but for now, thanks for reading, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight.
