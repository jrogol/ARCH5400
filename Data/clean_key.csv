2016-11-02T17:46:00Z,Hello and welcome,"Game seven. It?s been said they?re the two greatest words in sports ? besides, perhaps, free beer or brunch burger ? a one-off crucible where the winners through the years have been minted as legends and the losers cruelly fitted with goat horns. Tonight the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians will face off in the seventh game of a World Series that?s deadlocked at three games apiece. The ultramarathon that is the Major League Baseball season ? more than 200 games when you include spring training, the 162-game regular season and the play-offs ? is reduced to a sprint. All signs indicate tonight?s finale could be a classic, none more than the delicious starting pitching matchup between Indians? Corey Kluber and the Cubs? Kyle Hendricks, both Cy Young Award contenders for their respective leagues. We?ll unpack that and much more with first pitch a little more than six hours away.

2016-11-02T18:29:00Z,Tonight's starters,"Kluber and Hendricks are widely expected to finish high in the balloting for this year?s Cy Young Awards. That means tonight will likely mark only the third pitching matchup in a Game 7 of the World Series between starters to finish in the top five of Cy Young voting. The others? The Diamondbacks? Curt Schilling against the Yankees? Roger Clemens in 2001 and the Royals? Bret Saberhagen against the Cardinals? John Tudor in 1985. Both pitchers spoke with the media before last night?s Game 6. Here are some excerpts: Corey Kluber                                Corey Kluber starts for Cleveland tonight. Photograph: Jerry Lai/USA Today Sports   Given this has been your first postseason experience, how valuable do you think this month has been for you just in terms of overall development even moving forward? Kluber: I think first and foremost it?s been a blast. I think that we?ve all really enjoyed ourselves. I think we can take a lot from the way we approached it, and not treating it more than just each game is another game and trying to go out and win that day. Not trying to look too far ahead or things like that. I think there?s value to taking that approach throughout the course of a season, too. For years and years, the regular routine was to have starters pitch on three days? rest, and then in seven days it became four days. For you, what is the difference now that you?ve come back once on three days and might do it again tomorrow? Kluber: I mean, I guess for me personally I spend a little more time doing the different methods of recovery and stuff like that that we have available to us. But I still get in the same amount of work in between, it?s just a little bit more condensed. I haven?t, for me personally, I haven?t found much of a difference yet in the way I feel when I go out there on three days? rest as opposed to four. And I don?t know if that?s just doing the extra recovery stuff to where you get as close to normal as you can possibly get. But that?s really the only difference for me is spending more time trying to recover on those three days instead of having four days to do it. All season long you knew when you were going to pitch, and tomorrow obviously you don?t know if you?re going to pitch. So what is your mental frame thinking about tomorrow as of right now? Kluber: I mean, doing all my work in between the last start, and if it gets to tomorrow, that start. In doing all my work it was the same trying to get myself prepared. I?ll be rooting as hard as anybody for us to win tonight. But I think that my mindset was I?d rather be prepared and not have to pitch than try to will us to not get to a Game 7 and then not be ready when it comes. Kyle Hendricks                                Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago. Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA   Kyle, knock on wood, there?s a Game 7 for you tomorrow, what would it mean? It?s the ultimate in baseball to pitch a Game 7. Hendricks: Exactly, this is the ultimate dream. You dream of getting to the World Series, winning the World Series. When you?re out in your backyard as a kid, playing Little League at the field with your friends, this is the moment you dream about, Game 7, 3-2, two outs, something like that, bottom of the 9th. But it?s always Game 7 of the World Series. So when we get there tomorrow, I?m just going to embrace the opportunity like I have the rest of this postseason, honestly. Approach it like any other game, simple thoughts, the same old thing. You have a guy on your team who won a Game 7 in 2002 and won a Game 6 three years ago in John Lackey. Has he imparted any wisdom on you about how to handle tomorrow? Hendricks: Not particularly in regards to tomorrow, but I?ve learned so much from John already. I think the way he approaches every single game, you know, I think that?s what prepares him for those big games and that?s what I?ve learned watching him, and I?ve tried to implement some of that into my routine, just taking that same ruthless approach, every day, every single start, even the regular season. So that when you get to these big moments, it?s basically like it has been the whole year, I think. What?s your take on a team having a guy starting games 1, 4, and 7 and Kluber in particular? Hendricks: You know, I don?t think there?s too many guys that could do it to start, so obviously he?s a special guy. But Kluber, you can just see it. The way he takes to the mound, he?s always locked in. He has a very, very good mental approach from what you can see from the outside, keeping things simple, just trying to execute pitches. Like I said, there?s not many guys in this league that could do that. I think it speaks volumes to him as a pitcher and what he can do."
2016-11-02T19:23:00Z,Weather report,"We?ve experienced some chilly World Series in years past ? not least the 1997 Marlins-Indians series, where in a memorable Game 4, snow fell throughout the game and temperatures hovered around the 38F mark ? but tonight?s decider should be unseasonably warm. A chance of rain remains, however. We?re expecting temperatures in the upper 60s or lower 70s; the chance of rain increases from 19% at 8pm to about 50% by 11pm. Brian Wimer, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in a statement: ?While a brief shower cannot be ruled out during Wednesday evening, if Game 7 runs late or goes into extra innings, then the chance of drenching rain will increase.? Major League Baseball announced late on Tuesday night that it was moving up the start time by 8 minutes to 8pm."
2016-11-02T19:37:00Z,Jim Thome to throw first pitch,"Jim Thome, the Indians? franchise leader in home runs, will throw the first pitch at Progressive Field tonight. Former players from each team have thrown the first pitch prior to each game in the series. Thome, one of three players with a statue out beyond center field, played for the Indians between 1991 and 2002, and again in 2011. He was there the last time the Indians advanced to the World Series, in 1997 ? only to fall short against the Marlins in Game 7. Thome never again reached the World Series. ?It?s what you live for,? said Thome, who grew up a Cubs fan in Peoria, Illinois. ?It?s what you dream of. As an ex-player, you feel it with them. You want this to happen so badly.?"
2016-11-02T19:58:00Z,Tonight's starting line-ups,"Tyler Naquin has paid for his costly mistake in Game 6 ? and he?s out of the Indians line-up for tonight?s winner-takes-all showdown. Naquin, who let a fly ball turn into a two-run double in the first inning of Tuesday night?s loss, is out, and Rajai Davis is back in.                                 Naquin and Chisenhall get into a mix-up. Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports   Carlos Santana will lead off for the Indians, followed by Jason Kipnis, Francisco Lindor, Mike Napoli and Jose Ramirez. Lonnie Chisenhall will hit sixth, with Davis seventh, Coco Crisp eighth and Roberto Perez catching and hitting ninth. The Cubs, by contrast, are sticking with what works: they?ll use the same line-up that crushed the Indians 9-3 on Tuesday. Dexter Fowler will lead off, followed by Kyle Schwarber, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo. Ben Zobrist, who is hitting .391 in the series, will hit fifth. Addison Russell, who tied a World Series record with six RBIs in Game 6, will hit sixth, followed by Willson Contreras, Jason Heyward and Javier Baez. The Cubs have managed just one run off Kluber in his two starts so far."
2016-11-02T20:13:00Z,10) Memorable Game 7s: 1962,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history. They haven?t all been classics, but many of these winner-take-all affairs have served as platforms for baseball?s most unforgettable moments. As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 10) 1962 World Series | New York Yankees 1, San Francisco Giants 0 The Giants trailed 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth at Candlestick Park and were down to their final out, but they had runners at second and third with future Hall of Fame slugger Willie McCovey at the plate. That?s when McCovey ripped a line drive that surely would have driven in the championship-winning runs ? if not for Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson, whose hair-trigger catch for the final out preserved Ralph Terry?s four-hit shutout.

2016-11-02T20:44:00Z,9) Memorable Game 7s: 1975,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 9) 1975 World Series | Cincinnati Reds 4, Boston Red Sox 3 Everyone remembers Game 6 ? the instant classic settled by Carlton Fisk?s 12th-inning walk-off home run that Robin Williams? Dr Sean Maguire skipped out on to go see about a girl ? but that only forced a seventh game the next day. The Red Sox struck first with three runs in the third and the end of the team?s 57-year championship drought seemed within reach. But Tony Perez?s two-run homer off the Green Monster closed it to 3-2 in the sixth, Pete Rose tied it with an RBI single in the seventh and Joe Morgan?s two-out base hit to center field in the ninth capped Boston?s misery ? and gave birth to the Big Red Machine."
2016-11-02T20:58:00Z,8) Memorable Game 7s: 1955,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 8) 1955 World Series | Brooklyn Dodgers 2, New York Yankees 0 Next year finally came for the hard-luck Dodgers, who saw off the Yankees in the World Series after coming up short against their crosstown rivals in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953. The Dodgers scratched out runs on an RBI single and sacrifice fly by Gil Hodges, but it would prove enough Johnny Podres scattered eight hits over nine shutout innings to capture the first championship in franchise history and their lone win in Brooklyn. The game is perhaps best remembered for defensive substitute Sandy Amor?s? game-saving catch in left field off the bat of Yogi Berra, which keyed a 7-6-3 double play that short-circuited the Yankees? biggest threat of the day."
2016-11-02T21:27:00Z,7) Memorable Game 7s: 2014,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 7) 2014 World Series | San Francisco Giants 3, Kansas City Royals 2 The Giants had won Game 1 on a standout performance by Madison Bumgarner, then Game 5 when the right-hander pitched the first complete-game shutout in more than a decade in World Series play. But when the Royals forced a seventh game with a 10-0 victory in Game 6, the Giants ace went above and beyond the call of duty on two days? rest. After Michael Morse?s broken-bat RBI single broke a 2-2 deadlock in the fourth, Bumgarner entered to protect the one-run lead. He?d go on to hold the Royals scoreless over the final five innings ? retiring 14 batters in succession during one stretch ? for the longest save in World Series history."
2016-11-02T21:55:00Z,6) Memorable Game 7s: 1912,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

Game 2 at Fenway Park had been called for darkness ? but the teams were deadlocked at three wins apiece with the world championship on the table. They complete nine innings still knotted at 1-1 before the Giants broke through in the top of the 10th on Fred Merkle?s RBI single off Smokey Joe Wood. But the Red Sox ? no doubt aided by an easy fly ball by center fielder Fred Snodgrass that allowed leadoff batter Clyde Engle to reach second ? scratched out two runs against Hall of Fame hurler Christy Matthewson, who had pitched brilliantly to that point.

2016-11-02T22:06:00Z,5) Memorable Game 7s: 1997,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 5) 1997 World Series | Florida Marlins 3, Cleveland Indians 2 (11 innings) Here?s one that Indians fans of a certain age will no doubt be grappling with tonight. The last time Cleveland played in the World Series, they led 2-1 entering the bottom of the ninth of Game 7. But Jos? Mesa allowed singles by Mois?s Alou and Charles Johnson followed by a sacrifice fly by Craig Counsell that knotted the score at 2-2 and bought the Marlins new life in extra innings. With Cleveland?s Game 3 starter Charles Nagy having entered in relief, the Marlins loaded the bases in the bottom of the 11th ? thanks in part to a crucial error by second baseman Tony Fernandez on what might have been an inning-ending double play ? setting the stage for ?dgar Renter?a?s walkoff single to center."
2016-11-02T22:40:00Z,4) Memorable Game 7s: 1924,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 4) 1924 World Series | Washington Senators 4, New York Giants 3 (12 innings) Walter Johnson had already established himself as perhaps the greatest pitcher in baseball history ? a statement that stands today, incidentally ? but not until he was in the twilight of his career did the Big Train have the opportunity to pitch in the World Series. The 36-year-old right-hander lost both starts in Game 1 and Game 5, but was given a shot at redemption in Game 7 at Griffith Stadium after the Senators rallied from 3-1 down to tie the score in the bottom of the eighth. Johnson entered in the ninth and pitched four scoreless innings, earning the victory in relief after Earl McNeely?s championship-clinching RBI double in the bottom of the 12th."
2016-11-02T22:46:00Z,3) Memorable Game 7s: 2001,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 3) 2001 World Series | Arizona Diamondbacks 3, New York Yankees 2 A classic pitchers? duel between starters Curt Schilling and Roger Clemens (the AL Cy Young winner) was given even more juice when Randy Johnson (the NL Cy Young winner) entered in relief. Once Alfonso Soriano homered in the eighth to give New York a 2-1 lead, the outcome seemed but a handshake away. After all, the Yankees had Mariano Rivera waiting in the wings. But a two-inning save proved a bridge too far for the presumptive greatest closer ever as Rivera, who had struck out the side in the eighth, couldn?t work out of trouble in the ninth as Luis Gonzalez delivered the coup de gr?ce with an RBI blooper to center."
2016-11-02T22:49:00Z,2) Memorable Game 7s: 1991,"Tonight marks the 38th Game 7 in World Series history.

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 2) 1991 World Series | Minnesota Twins 1, Atlanta Braves 0 (10 innings) The so-called Worst to First Series featured two teams that had finished in last place only a year earlier, a happening unprecedented in baseball history. What came next was one of the hardest fought and most highly charged Fall Classics ever played, with five games decided by one run, four coming down to the final at-bat and three going to extra innings. Game 7 ticked all those boxes as Jack Morris of the Twins and John Smoltz of the Braves engaged in a pitchers? duel for the ages. Only after Morris threw an incredible 10 shutout innings did pinch hitter Gene Larkin close the show with a walk-off single in the bottom of the 10th."

As we count down the hours before tonight?s first pitch, we?re looking back at the 10 most memorable Game 7s in the annals of the Fall Classic. 1) 1960 World Series | Pittsburgh Pirates 10, New York Yankees 9 It was a bizarre World Series that saw the losing Yankees finish with more than twice as many runs on aggregate (55) than the winning Pirates (27), but you could hardly script a more exciting finale. The Pirates trailed 7-4 in the bottom of the eighth but responded with five runs, only to see the Yankees plate a pair to tie it at 9-9. Enter Bill Mazeroski, who won the game, and the championship, with the only walk-off home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series."

They had to watch their nearly flawless closer melt down. They had to bring on a pair of back-end roster relievers to pull it out.  It?s not that the trauma validates the achievement - a championship is a championship, as a sweep or in seven. But for this franchise, the lovable losers, it had to be tedious, heart-stopping and dramatic for the drought to end in a way that felt right  And it did.
